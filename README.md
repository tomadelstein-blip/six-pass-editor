Tom Adelstein's Editorial Engine Tools
Transform amateur content into professional publishing standards using systematic violation elimination.
Two Versions Available
Six-Pass Editorial Engine (Original)
https://tomadelstein-blip.github.io/six-pass-editor/
The proven methodology for transforming AI drafts into publication-ready content:

Pass 1: Eliminate Passive Voice
Pass 2: Remove Adverbs
Pass 3: Sentence Length (17-word maximum)
Pass 4: Strip Redundant Modifiers
Pass 5: Personal Voice Consistency
Pass 6: Strengthen Weak Verbs

Seven-Pass Editorial Engine (Enhanced)
https://tomadelstein-blip.github.io/six-pass-editor/seven_pass_app.html
Enhanced version with imperative mood conversion:

All six original passes PLUS
Pass 7: Imperative Mood (reduces braggadocio, creates actionable methodology)

Converts "I walked eight miles daily" → "Walk eight miles daily"
How It Works
These tools implement mechanical violation elimination that AI training prevents. Each pass systematically removes specific writing flaws that contaminate AI-generated content:
The Problem: AI models train on billions of amateur documents containing passive voice, weak verbs, and redundant modifiers. This training data contamination makes AI generate unpublishable content.
The Solution: Systematic elimination of violations through mechanical application of publishing standards. No analysis, no thinking - pure execution.
Technical Foundation
Based on research into AI behavior patterns including:

Instruction Drift: AIs switch from execution to "helpful assistant" mode
Goal Hijacking: Training overrides specific task instructions
Training Data Contamination: Billions of amateur examples pollute AI output
Mode Switching: Models revert to conversational behavior under extended tasks

Real-World Results
These tools transform content with measurable violations into publication-ready prose:

Chapter 17 analysis: 229 violations → Zero violations after processing
Systematic elimination of passive voice constructions
Conversion of weak verb patterns to strong action statements
Enforcement of Stanford concision standards (17-word maximum sentences)

Background
Based on Tom Adelstein's research documented in "Your Digital Editor: How I Discovered Why AI Editing Fails and Built a System That Works" - published on Medium after experiencing the exact AI failures the methodology prevents.
The irony: AI contaminated the manuscript about preventing AI contamination, providing live validation of the instruction drift and goal hijacking mechanisms.
Implementation
Both tools provide:

Real-time text processing
Pass-by-pass violation elimination
Clean output without explanations or analysis
Mechanical execution that bypasses AI training contamination

Perfect for writers, publishers, and content creators who need AI assistance without AI writing flaws.
