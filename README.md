*This web application implements the six-pass editorial system documented in the Medium article, providing a practical tool for eliminating AI writing violations.*

## How It Works
The six-pass system eliminates common AI writing failures:
1. **Passive Voice** - Ask "who is the actor?" 
2. **Adverbs** - Remove all "-ly" modifiers
3. **Sentence Length** - Maximum 17 words per sentence
4. **Redundant Modifiers** - Strip unnecessary qualifiers
5. **Personal Voice** - Maintain first-person narrative
6. **Strong Verbs** - Eliminate weak constructions
